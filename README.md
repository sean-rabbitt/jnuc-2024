Additional information and sample files from JNUC sessions

.mobileconfig files provide a sample baseline of PSSOe configurations.
You can upload them into Jamf Pro and edit to make changes to meet your 
organization's needs.

The file "Microsoft Platform Single Sign-On (PSSOe) - Kerberos Settings for on-premises resources"
should be modified to include your Kerberos domain.  Use in conjunction with
any PSSO payload.  Cloud Kerberos support needs to be enabled for your domain.
